# Driving Style Prediction Guide

## Problem: Always Getting "Aggressive" Prediction

If you're always getting "Aggressive" driving style, it's because your input values are too aggressive for the AI model.

## Solution: Adjust Your Input Values

The AI model is **very sensitive** to acceleration, braking, and speed values. Here's what the model considers:

### 🌱 **Eco-Friendly Driving**
- **Average Speed**: 35-50 km/h
- **Max Speed**: 45-60 km/h
- **Acceleration**: 0.3-1.0 m/s²
- **Braking**: 0.3-1.0 m/s²
- **Example**: Smooth city driving, gentle on pedals

### 🚗 **Normal Driving**
- **Average Speed**: 50-70 km/h
- **Max Speed**: 60-85 km/h
- **Acceleration**: 1.0-2.0 m/s²
- **Braking**: 1.0-2.0 m/s²
- **Example**: Regular highway driving, moderate acceleration

### 🏎️ **Aggressive Driving**
- **Average Speed**: 70+ km/h
- **Max Speed**: 85+ km/h
- **Acceleration**: 2.0+ m/s²
- **Braking**: 2.0+ m/s²
- **Example**: Fast acceleration, hard braking, high speeds

## Updated Default Values

The frontend has been updated with **realistic default values** that should give you "Normal" predictions:

- **Average Speed**: 45 km/h
- **Max Speed**: 55 km/h
- **Average Acceleration**: 0.8 m/s²
- **Average Braking**: 0.8 m/s²

## Testing Different Scenarios

### To Get "Eco" Prediction:
```
Distance: 50 km
Elevation: 50 m
Avg Speed: 40 km/h
Max Speed: 50 km/h
Acceleration: 0.5 m/s²
Braking: 0.5 m/s²
Duration: 75 min
```

### To Get "Normal" Prediction:
```
Distance: 50 km
Elevation: 100 m
Avg Speed: 45 km/h
Max Speed: 55 km/h
Acceleration: 0.8 m/s²
Braking: 0.8 m/s²
Duration: 67 min
```

### To Get "Aggressive" Prediction:
```
Distance: 50 km
Elevation: 200 m
Avg Speed: 100 km/h
Max Speed: 130 km/h
Acceleration: 4.0 m/s²
Braking: 5.0 m/s²
Duration: 30 min
```

## Understanding Acceleration & Braking Values

**What is m/s²?**
- It's meters per second squared - how fast your speed changes
- 1 m/s² ≈ going from 0 to 10 km/h in 2.8 seconds
- Higher values = more aggressive acceleration/braking

**Real-world examples:**
- **0.5 m/s²**: Very gentle - like grandma driving
- **1.0 m/s²**: Normal - typical careful driver
- **2.0 m/s²**: Sporty - enthusiastic driver
- **3.0+ m/s²**: Aggressive - racing style

## Why This Happens

The AI model was trained on real driving data where:
- Most drivers accelerate gently (0.5-1.5 m/s²)
- Hard acceleration (2.0+ m/s²) is considered aggressive
- The old default values (2.0 and 2.5) were in the aggressive range

The model is working correctly - it was just the default frontend values that were unrealistic!

## Tips for Accurate Predictions

1. **Use realistic values** based on your actual driving habits
2. **Lower values = more eco-friendly** predictions
3. **Check the hints** below each input field for guidance
4. **Experiment** with different values to see how the prediction changes
5. **Remember**: The goal is to help you drive more efficiently, not to judge!

## Energy Impact

- **Eco driving**: Saves 15-30% energy
- **Normal driving**: Baseline consumption
- **Aggressive driving**: Uses 20-40% more energy

Choose eco-friendly values to maximize your EV's range! 🔋
